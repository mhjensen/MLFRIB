\item[Description:] In nuclear collisions, emitted charged particles are detected by radiation detectors. Particle identification can be obtained from plotting the energy loss vs. total energy or momentum)as shown in the left panel of the figure. We test the machine learning algorithm using Monte Carlo events (right panel) from the TPC. A fully connected, feed-forward neural network classifier is used to separate out the various reaction products from simulated SpiRIT data. Initially, we achieved an accuracy of 88%. With some tuning of the background, we now achieve 97%, 92%, 85%, 77% and 88% for pions, p, d, t, 3He and alpha particles respectively. We are progressing to train and tune the algorithm with real data. We plan to apply the method to identify the PID constructed from data taken with the NSCL High Resolution Array (HiRA)as PIDâ€™s are ubiquitous in nuclear physics experiments with the most common ones being the Si-CsI telescopes [Dell19]
