\item[Description:] We have recently started to explore several approaches based on deep
learning algorithms, with an emphasis on neural networks and so-called
Boltzmann machines, with several promising results for interacting
many-fermion systems. Our applications
so far have been to systems of electrons confined to move in two or
three-dimensional regions (so-called quantum dots) and systems of
bosons (weakly and strongly interacting) using a mix of neural network
based algorithms and variational quantum Monte Carlo approaches. We are in the process of extending these calculations
to nuclear physics problems.
