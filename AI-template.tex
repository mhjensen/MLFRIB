\section{Machine Learning and AI in Nuclear Physics}


Artificial intelligence (AI)-based techniques, particularly in machine
learning (ML) and optimization, are increasingly being used in many areas
of experimental and theoretical physics to facilitate discovery,
accelerate data analysis and modeling efforts, and bridge different
physical and temporal scales in numerical models.
The large amount of degrees of freedom pertain to both theory and experiment in nuclear physics. With increasingly complicated experiments that produce large amounts data, automated classification of events becomes increasingly important. 
Artificial intelligence and Machine Learning   techniques are proving to be powerful tools for advancing our
understanding of the physics from complicated nuclear systems. 



\subsection{Types of Machine Learning}



The approaches to machine learning are many, but are often split into two main categories. 
In \emph{supervised learning} we have a situation with known input and output data that we want to reproduce with a given set of models, letting the given machine learning algorithm deduce the eventual logic behind our data. 

On the other hand, \emph{unsupervised learning}
is a method for finding patterns and relationship in data sets without any prior knowledge of the system.
Some authors also operate with a third category, namely \emph{reinforcement learning}. This is a paradigm 
of learning inspired by behavioural psychology, where learning is achieved by trial-and-error, 
solely from rewards and punishment.

Some of the most common tasks are:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Classification: Outputs are divided into two or more classes. The goal is to   produce a model that assigns inputs into one of these classes. An example is to identify  digits based on pictures of hand-written ones. 

  \item Regression: Finding a functional relationship between an input data set and a reference data set.   The goal is to construct a function that maps input data to continuous output values.

  \item Clustering: Data are divided into groups with certain common traits, without knowing the different groups beforehand.  It is thus a form of unsupervised learning.
\end{itemize}
These categories are all part of the broad spectrum of AI and ML techniques being studied at FRIB.

\item[Participants] F. Montes, H. Schatz,  K. Hermansen (g), S. Ayoub (g), D. Crisp, T. Summers and A.M. Amthor (Bucknell)
\item[Description] The primary purpose of the The SEparator for CApture Reactions (SECAR) at FRIB is to measure resonance strengths in radiative proton and alpha capture reactions for astrophysics. We have developed and tested systems to interpret data in real-time from existing spectrometer and beam-line systems to tune multiple elements to provide desired beam properties without providing the autonomous system a theoretical model of the particle-optical system being tuned. 
%This autonomous beam tuning was the first technique to produce nearly 100\% transmission through the target aperture in the SECAR target system. 
Preliminary SECAR optimization simulations have shown that such a technique can also be used to produce an achromatic dispersive image in SECAR by using autonomous optimization approaches such as a GP, NN and/or the Particle Swarm method. We are now working toward a further test of the automated optimization to 
%correctly tune the incoming beam into SECAR and to <We already did this, no?>
independently minimize the beam-spot size at different critical positions in SECAR, thus maximizing beam purity and mass resolving power, which are critical to maximizing the scientific productivity of SECAR. 
\item[FRIB relevance] Automated optimization is expected to reduce tuning time and improve quality and consistency of SECAR performance. These techniques are also applicable to other FRIB accelerator, beam-line, and spectrometer systems.

%%%
\item[Description:] When a neutron-rich
nucleus beta decays, a neutron transforms into a proton and emits an electron $\beta$. The excited nucleus can then interact electromagnetically with the surrounding orbital electrons. This can result in the ejection of an internal conversion electron $e^{-}$ from the atom.
Because this process is essentially simultaneous in time, it is pivotal to differentiate between the electron $\beta$ emitted from the nucleus and the internal conversion electron $e^{-}$ emitted from the atom. We have used, with success, various classification methods, in particular CNNs, AEs, RNNSs and VAEs to 
to distinguish between one and two electron events and predict the
electron(s) corresponding initial position(s).

\item[Description:] In nuclear collisions, physics information is obtained from emitted charged particles measured with radiation detectors.  Identification of the emitted particles (PID) can be obtained from plotting the energy loss vs. total energy or momentum) as shown in the left panel of the figure. The data was obtained from S$\pi$RIT Time Projection Chamber. We test the ML algorithm using Monte Carlo events (right panel) from the TPC. A fully connected, feedforward NN classifier is used to separate out the various reaction products from simulated S$\pi$RIT data. Initially, we achieved an accuracy of $88\%$. However, with background tuning, we now achieve $97\%$, $92\%$, $85\%$, $77\%$ and $88\%$ for $\pi$, p, d, t, $^3$He and $\alpha$ particles respectively. We plan to train and tune the algorithm with real data. We will extend the method to identify the PID lines constructed from data taken with the NSCL High Resolution Array (HiRA). 
%%%
\item[FRIB relevance:] PID lines are ubiquitous observable in nearly all nuclear physics experiments that detect charged particles. ML tools and strategies will be needed for fast particle identifications to facilitate the huge amount of data from FRIB experiments.

\item[Description:] The few-body group has been exploring statistical methods in nuclear reactions. 
In 2018 we compared, directly and systematically, the frequentist and Bayesian approaches to quantifying uncertainties in direct nuclear reactions. Our study demonstrated that the uncertainties on the reaction observables considered  within the Bayesian approach  represent reality more accurately than the much narrower uncertainties obtained using the standard frequentist approach.

\item[Description:]  

In recent work we study the uncertainties of optical model parameters and its dependence on the angular grid of the differential cross section, the inclusion of cross section data at nearby energies, and changes in the experimental error bars.  We also study the effect on the resulting uncertainty when total reaction cross sections are included in the fitting procedure. 

In the last years, we have been expanding our methods to include the PCA and BML to identify the optimum experimental conditions and the best combination of observables to reduce the uncertainty on the resulting cross sections. Once this is completed, we plan to use these statistical tools to make model comparisons and eventually, if it makes sense, to perform BMA
\item[FRIB relevance:] To plan reactions measurements at FRIB it is important to know what are the optimum conditions and the optimum observables (or combination of observables) that provide maximum information content.

Transport model theory predicts that ratios of neutron and proton energy spectra provide constraints on the density and momentum dependencies of the isovector mean-field potential. To extract the parameters of the equation of state, ($\rho$, S($\rho$), $m_n^*$, $m_p^*$ corresponding to density,  symmetry energy,  neutron and proton effective masses, respectively), we compare single and double n/p ratios obtained from central collisions of $^{112}$Sn+$^{112}$Sn and $^{124}$Sn+$^{124}$Sn at 120 MeV/u to a transport model calculations. Using Bayesian analysis which samples millions of parameter sets, we obtain the 1 and 2 sigma contours of the density dependence of the symmetry energy (see figure). For the effective mass, the results are more ambiguous. We need better data especially at higher kinetic energy where sensitivity to the effective mass splitting is larger.

\item[Description:] 
We use a Bayesian inference analysis to explore the sensitivity of Taylor expansion parameters of
the nuclear equation of state (EOS) to the neutron star dimensionless tidal deformability ($\Lambda$) obtained
from the neutron star merger event GW170817. To avoid correlations between the expansion
parameters, we use a prior distributions based on a recently published meta-modeling approach.
However, we find that assumptions in the prior distribution strongly
influence the constraints on $\Lambda$.
The sensitivity study is extended beyond the canonical neutron star with 1.4 solar mass. For neutron
star with mass < 1.6 solar mass, $L_{sym}$ and $K_{sym}$ are highly correlated with the tidal deformability.
For more massive neutron stars, the tidal deformability is more strongly correlated with higher order
Taylor expansion parameters.

\item[Description:]
Equation-of-state analyses require rigorous comparison of large heterogeneous data sets to sophisticated models, using input from nuclear structure, heavy-ion collisions and astrophysical observations. Due to the numerical expense of theoretical models model emulators have been employed to explore the highly multi-dimensional model space. Emulators approximate the full model by interpolating from a modest number of full-model runs, but even with an emulator these studies push the limits of large computing facilities. For example, the Bayesian exploration summarized in the figure below involved 1200 full model runs over a 14-dimensional parameter space. One must choose how many full model runs to perform, and at which points, and with what accuracy. If the runs require a sampling of events, should one sample fewer events or use the computational budget to explore more points in parameter space.  Machine learning provides a natural strategy for guiding and optimizing these studies. Such optimizations might save large amounts of computational expense, and make certain studies tenable that might otherwise be inconceivable.

\section{Education and Workforce}

AI, ML, statistical data analysis and related areas are expected to
play an ever-increasing role in many areas, from fundamental and
applied research at universities and national laboratories to
applications and developments in both the private and the public
sectors.
Developing basic research activities in these frontier
computational technologies is thus of strategic importance for our
society’s capability to address future scientific problems. Transfer
of knowledge to other disciplines and sectors, as well as developing
lasting collaborations with partners outside the traditional
university sector, are themes we expect will benefit society at large
and that will play central roles. Nuclear Physics keeps attracting many brilliant young researchers and providing our work force with these competences and skills for solving complicated physics problems is a compelling task for our community.


\begin{itemize}

\item In order to develop education and training efforts that target AI and ML related methods applied to Nuclear Physics, we  organized in 2019 a four day long  FRIB-TA workshop on ML methods in Nuclear physics at the NSCL/FRIB, with more than 100 participants.

\item In 2020 several of us (Bazin, Hjorth-Jensen and Liddick) will teach a three-week long Nuclear Talent course on Machine Learning and Data Analysis applied to nuclear physics. 


\item From spring 2020 (April and May, and planned to be repeated on an annual basis) we will host and run intensive courses on Machine Learning, Bayesian statistics and statistical data analysis for students and faculty in theoretical and experimental nuclear physics. The aim is to develop a large amount of material with lectures notes, videos, projects and hands-on material that can serve the whole nuclear Physics community. An example of possible material can found at \href{https://compphysics.github.io/MachineLearning/doc/web/course.html}.  The format of the course is similar to a Nuclear TALENT course.

\item
We initiated the series of meetings on {\it Enhancing the interaction between nuclear experiment and theory through information and statistics} \href{https://iopscience.iop.org/journal/0954-3899/page/ISNET}{(ISNET)}.  The next ISNET-8 will be held at FRIB during  Dec. 14-17th, 2020.

\subsubsection{Particle reconstruction of Time Projection Chamber}

\item[Description:] To investigate the ``nature of neutron-rich matter in the cosmos and on earth'' is one of the scientific objectives laid out in the 2015 NSAC Long Range Plan. With the energy and the availability of rare isotope beams, FRIB and FRIB400 are poised to study the Equation of State of asymmetric matter. One observable to study the EoS is to compare the relative emission of members of isospin multiplets, e.g. $\pi^-$ vs. $\pi^+$, $n$ vs. $p$, $t$ vs. $^3\mathrm{He}$, etc., which experience symmetry potentials and symmetry forces of opposite sign. Time projection chamber (TPC) provides large coverage to detect charged particles including pions emitted in heavy ion collisions (See figures). However, with mean multiplicity of 50 in the example shown, it becomes a challenge to reconstruct particle tracks, identify and accurately determine the momenta of the particles. We are looking into applying machine learning reconstruction algorithms pioneered in high energy physics. 
%%%
\item[FRIB relevance:]  The SpiRIT TPC (funded by DOE) will be moved from RIKEN to FRIB.  When the TPC is placed inside the HRS, it will be the anchor detector for the Equation of State program at FRIB and FRIB400. Both online and offline analysis of TPC data will require fast and accurate reconstruction of the particle tracks.

\item[Description:] With the advancement of digital electronics, we are able to record the waveforms of the signal pulses directly. That allows automation and innovation in data analysis. Depending on the detector materials, waveforms may contain information about the particle types and the corresponding energy. The figure below shows the waveforms identified using new improved method (right panel) to distinguish neutrons from gammas detected by a large array made from organic liquid scintillator from an experiment at NSCL. The pulse shape (left panel) depends on the position of the detector where the radiation hit. It is a complicated multi-correlation problem suitable for developing machine learning algorithm using separate data sets for training and validating.
%%%
\item[FRIB relevance:] Digital electronics  produces large amount of information and are increasingly used in nuclear physics experiments including those in FRIB. To exploit the full potential of digial electronics, fast machine learning algorithms must be developed to classify pulse shapes for different particle types in online or offline analysis.
