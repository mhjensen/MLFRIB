\section{Machine Learning and AI in Nuclear Physics}


Artificial intelligence (AI)-based techniques, particularly in machine
learning (ML) and optimization, are increasingly being used in many areas
of experimental and theoretical physics to facilitate discovery,
accelerate data analysis and modeling efforts, and bridge different
physical and temporal scales in numerical models.
The large amount of degrees of freedom pertain to both theory and experiment in nuclear physics. With increasingly complicated experiments that produce large amounts data, automated classification of events becomes increasingly important. 
Artificial intelligence and Machine Learning   techniques are proving to be powerful tools for advancing our
understanding of the physics from complicated nuclear systems. 



\subsection{Types of Machine Learning}



The approaches to machine learning are many, but are often split into two main categories. 
In \emph{supervised learning} we have a situation with known input and output data that we want to reproduce with a given set of models, letting the given machine learning algorithm deduce the eventual logic behind our data. 

On the other hand, \emph{unsupervised learning}
is a method for finding patterns and relationship in data sets without any prior knowledge of the system.
Some authors also operate with a third category, namely \emph{reinforcement learning}. This is a paradigm 
of learning inspired by behavioural psychology, where learning is achieved by trial-and-error, 
solely from rewards and punishment.

Some of the most common tasks are:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Classification: Outputs are divided into two or more classes. The goal is to   produce a model that assigns inputs into one of these classes. An example is to identify  digits based on pictures of hand-written ones. 

  \item Regression: Finding a functional relationship between an input data set and a reference data set.   The goal is to construct a function that maps input data to continuous output values.

  \item Clustering: Data are divided into groups with certain common traits, without knowing the different groups beforehand.  It is thus a form of unsupervised learning.
\end{itemize}
These categories are all part of the broad spectrum of AI and ML techniques being studied at FRIB.

\item[Description] The primary purpose of the The SEparator for CApture Reactions (SECAR) at FRIB is to measure resonance strengths in radiative proton and alpha capture reactions for astrophysics. We have developed and tested systems to interpret data in real-time from existing spectrometer and beam-line systems to tune multiple elements to provide desired beam properties without providing the autonomous system a theoretical model of the particle-optical system being tuned. 
%This autonomous beam tuning was the first technique to produce nearly 100\% transmission through the target aperture in the SECAR target system. 
Preliminary SECAR optimization simulations have shown that such a technique can also be used to produce an achromatic dispersive image in SECAR by using autonomous optimization approaches such as a GP, NN and/or the Particle Swarm method. We are now working toward a further test of the automated optimization to 
%correctly tune the incoming beam into SECAR and to <We already did this, no?>
independently minimize the beam-spot size at different critical positions in SECAR, thus maximizing beam purity and mass resolving power, which are critical to maximizing the scientific productivity of SECAR. 
\item[FRIB relevance] Automated optimization is expected to reduce tuning time and improve quality and consistency of SECAR performance. These techniques are also applicable to other FRIB accelerator, beam-line, and spectrometer systems.

\begin{description}
%%%
\item[Participants:] D. Weisshaar, A. Gade, L. Neufcourt, J. Chung
\item[Description:]  Gamma-ray tracking algorithms determine how many $\gamma$ rays got fully or partially absorbed in an event by analyzing the measured interaction positions and energy depositions. 
%%ML techniques like NN are trained on measured data sets by analyzing the pattern of interaction points. 
Experimental energy measurements and computer simulations can constitute a large set of data
on which ML models such as neural networks can be trained to identify patterns in interaction points.
This approach does make no assumption about the underlying scattering processes (Compton scatter, Photo effect, pair production) as state-of-the-art deterministic algorithms do, especially the handling of wrongly reported interaction points by the detectors. 

%%%
\item[FRIB relevance:] The Gamma-Ray Energy Tracking Array GRETA will be one of the premium devices at FRIB. Improvement on its tracking capability in terms of better identification of incomplete absorbed $\gamma$ rays will directly translate into better spectral quality and sensitivity of this device, enlarging its scientific reach.

\item[Description:] 
%In the searching for a predictive model of the atomic nucleus,  critical  benchmarks  between  theory  and  experiment  can  be  found  in  the  properties  of  rare  isotopes. 
Shape coexistence is a phenomenon in which promotion of  nucleons  across  an  energy  gap  can  become  energetically favored and coexist at low-excitation energies with standard  shell  model  configurations.   %Locations  where shape  coexistence  occurs  provides  a  critical  benchmark of  theoretical  models  far  from  stability.   
Shape  coexistence can be sensitively studied following the population of specific states in beta decay that subsequently undergo E0 electromagnetic transitions.  Such transitions are forbidden to proceed through gamma-ray emission and instead occur through the emission of an internal conversion electron.  The resulting experimental signature is the emission of two electrons. %from an identical position in the volume of the detector.

%This process is essentially simultaneous in time, it is pivotal to differentiate between the electron $\beta$ emitted from the nucleus and the internal conversion electron $e^{-}$ emitted from the atom. 
We have used, with success, various classification methods to distinguish between various electron processes, in particular CNNs, AEs, RNNSs and VAEs to to distinguish between one and two electron events and predict the
electron(s) corresponding initial position(s) and energies.  
%The techniques can be extended to cases where the emissions are separated in space allowing for the characterization of standard gamma-decaying isomeric states.

%%%
\item[FRIB relevance:] We expect that many of the new FRIB experiments will produce large amounts of data with loose triggering conditions that can be used to achieve multiple high-impact results for each experiment. The techniques developed here will enable access to scientific outcomes that are difficult or impossible with current technology.

\item[Participants:] C. Dembsky (u), C. Arbour (u), S. N. Liddick, S. Spyrou, M. Hjorth-Jensen
%%%
\item[Description:] 
The technique of total absorption spectroscopy was developed more than 30 years ago to provide an accurate measurement of the beta-decay feeding into different excitation energies of the nucleus.  The beta-decay feeding intensity is a sensitive probe to study the structure of the nucleus as it has different distributions depending on the shape of the nucleus of interest.  The feeding intensity is also critical in a number of applications ranging from astrophysics to national security.  The response of a large volume gamma-ray total absorption spectrometer is complex and depends sensitively on the excitation energy, the individual gamma-ray energies, and the gamma-ray multiplicity.  The application of machine learning could greatly impact the accuracy and speed of extracting scientific insight from experimental data.

%%%
\item[FRIB relevance:] Total absorption experiments at FRIB will play a significant role in the beta-decay program.  The application of machine learning could greatly impact the accuracy and speed of extracting scientific insight from experimental data.  Once demonstrated, the technique could be extended to other experimental systems with lower efficiencies and higher energy resolutions.

Identification of the emitted particles (PID) can be obtained from plotting the energy loss vs. total energy or momentum) as shown in the left panel of the figure. The data was obtained from S$\pi$RIT Time Projection Chamber. We test the ML algorithm using Monte Carlo events (right panel) from the TPC. A fully connected, feedforward NN classifier is used to separate out the various reaction products from simulated S$\pi$RIT data. Initially, we achieved an accuracy of $88\%$. However, with background tuning, we now achieve $97\%$, $92\%$, $85\%$, $77\%$ and $88\%$ for $\pi$, p, d, t, $^3$He and $\alpha$ particles respectively. We plan to train and tune the algorithm with real data. We will extend the method to identify the PID lines constructed from data taken with the NSCL High Resolution Array (HiRA).

\item[Description:] ML methods make it possible to tackle the curse of dimensionality and allow us to model quantum mechanical systems with less a priori knowledge. For complex many-body systems like nuclei (especially those at the limits of stability) or nuclear matter, this is a very interesting avenue to explore.  We have recently applied DL methods --- particular RNNs, LSTM and KRR --- to Similarity
Renormalization Group flows and the solution of Coupled Cluster theory, with a great deal of success. Our preliminary studies hold great promise for handling systems with large numbers of particles (including nuclear matter) or basis states (e.g. due to deformation or continuum coupling).
%%%
\item[FRIB relevance:]  Theoretical studies of nuclei at the limits of stability are a great challenge due to the large number of degrees of freedom. These systems are highly relevant for the scientific program of FRIB.

so far have been to systems of electrons confined to move in two or

To extract the parameters of the equation of state, ($\rho$, S($\rho$), $m_n^*$, $m_p^*$ corresponding to density,  symmetry energy,  neutron and proton effective masses, respectively), we compare single and double n/p ratios obtained from central collisions of $^{112}$Sn+$^{112}$Sn and $^{124}$Sn+$^{124}$Sn at 120 MeV/u to a transport model calculations. Using Bayesian analysis which samples millions of parameter sets, we obtain the 1 and 2 sigma contours of the density dependence of the symmetry energy (see figure). For the effective mass, the results are more ambiguous. We need better data especially at higher kinetic energy where sensitivity to the effective mass splitting is larger.

The sensitivity study is extended beyond the canonical neutron star with 1.4 solar mass. For neutron
star with mass < 1.6 solar mass, $L_{sym}$ and $K_{sym}$ are highly correlated with the tidal deformability.
For more massive neutron stars, the tidal deformability is more strongly correlated with higher order

\item[Description:]
Equation-of-state analyses require rigorous comparison of large heterogeneous data sets to sophisticated models, using input from nuclear structure, heavy-ion collisions and astrophysical observations. Due to the numerical expense of theoretical models model emulators have been employed to explore the highly multi-dimensional model space. Emulators approximate the full model by interpolating from a modest number of full-model runs, but even with an emulator these studies push the limits of large computing facilities. For example, the Bayesian exploration summarized in the figure below involved 1200 full model runs over a 14-dimensional parameter space. One must choose how many full model runs to perform, and at which points, and with what accuracy. If the runs require a sampling of events, should one sample fewer events or use the computational budget to explore more points in parameter space.  Machine learning provides a natural strategy for guiding and optimizing these studies. Such optimizations might save large amounts of computational expense, and make certain studies tenable that might otherwise be inconceivable.

Symmetry energy quantifies changes in the nuclear equation of state with changes in the neutron-proton imbalance.  Knowledge of the symmetry energy as a function of density is essential for extrapolating from nuclear laboratory measurements to properties of neutron stars.

By simultaneously analyzing data from nucleon elastic scattering and nucleon quasielastic charge exchange reactions for the same targets and combining these analyses with results of other data on isospin characteristics of nuclei, in layers of Bayesian inference, Danielewicz et al. placed constraints on stiffness of the symmetry energy.

\section{Education and Workforce}

There are only 26,000 AI researchers currently in the US. This is estimated to represent only a fifth of the current demand. There is an urgent need for training in AI, at a variety of educational levels and for diverse audiences. To this end, beyond our research efforts, we develop a range of outreach, recruitment, and educational activities. These activities will serve to raise interest in AI-related fields. We aim to retain talented students in AI-related fields and to help them to secure employment in a wide range of careers, thus ensuring that the new techniques and concepts developed at FRIB are widely disseminated.


\begin{itemize}

\item In order to develop education and training efforts that target AI and ML related methods applied to Nuclear Physics, in 2019 we  organized a four day long  \href{https://indico.frib.msu.edu/event/16/timetable/?view=standard}{FRIB-TA workshop} on {\it ML methods in Nuclear physics} at  NSCL/FRIB, with more than 100 participants.

\item In 2020 several of us (Bazin, Hjorth-Jensen and Liddick) will teach a three-week long Nuclear Talent course at ECT*  on \href{https://www.ectstar.eu/node/4472}{Machine Learning and Data Analysis applied to nuclear physics}. 


\item From spring 2020 (April and May, and planned to be repeated on an annual basis) we will host and run intensive courses on ML, Bayesian inference, and statistical data analysis for students and faculty in theoretical and experimental nuclear physics. The aim is to develop a large amount of material with lectures notes, videos, projects and hands-on material that can serve the whole nuclear Physics community. An example of possible material can found at \href{https://compphysics.github.io/MachineLearning/doc/web/course.html}.  The format of the course is similar to a Nuclear TALENT course.

\item
We initiated the series of meetings on {\it Enhancing the interaction between nuclear experiment and theory through information and statistics} \href{https://isnet-series.github.io/meetings/isnet/}{(ISNET)}.  The next ISNET-8 will be held at FRIB during  Dec. 14-17th, 2020.

With the energy and the availability of rare isotope beams, FRIB and FRIB400 are poised to study the Equation of State of asymmetric matter. One observable to study the EoS is to compare the relative emission of members of isospin multiplets, e.g. $\pi^-$ vs. $\pi^+$, $n$ vs. $p$, $t$ vs. $^3\mathrm{He}$, etc., which experience symmetry potentials and symmetry forces of opposite sign. Time projection chamber (TPC) provides large coverage to detect charged particles including pions emitted in heavy ion collisions (See figures). However, with mean multiplicity of 50 in the example shown, it becomes a challenge to reconstruct particle tracks, identify and accurately determine the momenta of the particles. We are looking into applying ML reconstruction algorithms pioneered in high energy physics.

An important tool to select and separate the correct particle are characteristic plots of energy loss in matter vs. time-of-flight, measured in relation to a fixed accelerator RF phase. Depending on beam and separator conditions, particles with a large number of different N, Z and charge states can contribute to the dE-ToF plots, turning particle ID into a challenge. Known patterns of particles with certain relations of N, Z and RF period, as well as energy-loss relations can be exploited for orientation. Complementary codes are being developed in order to assist and automate the particle-ID process. ML algorithms, e.g. ones popular for image matching, are being evaluated to map calculated plots, e.g.\ obtained with the LISE++ code, to the experimental ones.

These collisions further act as a black-body source yielding all products allowed by energy conservation and time scale for production, including unstable many-body states that decay in a variety of ways in the aftermath of the collision.  
Past development of strategies for extracting useful information from the mutiparticle final states of the collision was driven by intuitions but these do not stack up well against the vast amount of information nominally contained in the multiparticle measurements. The potential of AI techniques to access such information has been already demonstrated for ultrarelativistic collisions.  Nzabahimanan and Danielewicz progress in applying AI to the multiparticle states at FRIB energies concentrating first on the identification of excited states with complicated decay patterns.
